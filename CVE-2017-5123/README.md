Exploits for CVE-2017-5123
These exploits exploit the Linux Kernel vulnerability CVE-2017-5123, which I found and reported.
The exploits can be used to escape from the Chrome sanbox, so the pocs here begin by setting up the sandbox to emulate the real one.

A full writeup explaining the exploits is available on https://salls.github.io/Linux-Kernel-CVE-2017-5123/

I included two different exploits. One is reliable but doesn't bypass SMAP, the other bypasses SMAP, but crashes the kernel around half of the time.

Exploits only have correct offsets for Ubuntu on kernel 4.13.0-12-generic
